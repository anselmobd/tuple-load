# tuple-load
Loading CVS tuples in relational databases.

- cvs_validate.py - In this script are the first steps of the project. Initially implementing a simple validation.

## For routine testing.

- tables.cfg - Configuration file, which for the moment is only used to link an intelegable table name to the table name in an RDB. The intelegable name is the name of the CSV file (with a .csv), which contains the tuples (the data). The table name in the RDB is the name of the JSON file (with a .json), which contains information about the columns of the table.

- tamanho.csv - First set of tuples.

- BASI_220.json - First file with information from a table.
